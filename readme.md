Daily Routine (2 Hours)
6:00 AM - 7:00 AM: DSA Preparation
Warm-Up (10 mins):



7:00 AM - 8:00 AM: Machine Coding Preparation
Watch the Video (20-30 mins):

Watch the machine coding video from the playlist.

Focus on understanding the problem statement, approach, and implementation.

Implement the Component (30-40 mins):

Build the component from scratch.

Use CodeSandbox, CodePen, or your local development environment.

Test and Debug (10 mins):

Test your implementation for edge cases and bugs.

Optimize the code for performance and readability.

Key Patterns
Arrays
Two Pointers: Pair sums, removing duplicates, comparing elements.

Sliding Window: Subarrays with specific conditions (e.g., maximum sum).

Prefix Sum: Subarray sums, range queries.

Sorting and Searching: Sorted arrays, rotated arrays, finding specific elements.

Dynamic Programming: Optimization problems (e.g., maximum product subarray).

Strings
Two Pointers: Palindromes, comparing characters.

Sliding Window: Substrings with specific conditions (e.g., longest substring without repeats).

Hash Map: Anagrams, frequency counting.

Dynamic Programming: Substring matching, word break, decoding.

Greedy Algorithm: Local optimization (e.g., string compression).

Tips for Success
Stay Consistent:

Stick to the timetable and avoid skipping days.
